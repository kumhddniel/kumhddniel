<h1>Assignments and Project</h1>

<h2>Assignment 1 : Report (Video Games Website Analysis Using Google Lighthouse.pdf)</h2>

For this assignment, our group, Special Force, is utilizing Google Lighthouse tools to perform a technical audit of a website. We chose a gaming website to test with Google Lighthouse. This was my first experience using such tools to gain insights into a website's performance, accessibility, SEO and best practices. I suggest that the assignment should allow for more than five pages for the report as the current limit is insufficient, forcing us to trim our content further to meet the page requirement.

<h2>Assignment 2 : Website (https://kumhddniel.github.io/#kudan)</h2>

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this assignment. It provided us with a foundational understanding of how to create a website and make it highly interactive. The website we developed focuses on cars and consists of a single page. It also includes features such as reference links, sections and the implementation of various CSS tools. I have no suggestions for improvement as the assignment is already well-executed.

<h2>Assignment 3 : Github E-Portfolio (https://github.com/kumhddniel/kumhddniel/blob/main/README.md)</h2>

This assignment allowed me to delve into the use of GitHub. I found it fascinating as I explored various functions within GitHub and realizing how it can simplify my future assignments. Since this tool is new to me, I spent considerable time learning how to use it effectively. Like Assignment 2, I don't have many suggestions for improvement as it is already well-designed.

<h2>Project : Parcel Management Center (https://utmparcel.000webhostapp.com/)</h2>

This assignment is somewhat similar to Assignment 2 but more advanced. I found it quite challenging especially when implementing the PHP tools. We decided to create a Parcel Management Center for our university and dividing the project into several web pages and then combining them. While this assignment is very challenging, it is also fun to work on. I don't have any additional comments for improvement but I hope future assignments might be a bit easier.
